# Project Description:

This is a recipe application built using React and Zustand state management. The application allows users to browse and interact with a collection of recipes. It provides the following features:

Recipe List: The application fetches recipes from an external API (Punk API) using the fetchRecipes function from the Zustand store. The recipes are displayed as cards in a responsive grid layout using the RecipeCard component.

Pagination and Lazy Loading: The recipe list is paginated, and initially, 15 recipes are rendered. As the user scrolls down to the bottom of the list, additional recipes are lazily loaded from the API and added to the rendered list. This ensures a smooth browsing experience while maintaining a total of 15 rendered recipes on the screen.

Recipe Details: Users can click on a recipe card to view its details on a separate page. The recipe details page is implemented using the React Router, where each recipe has a unique URL based on its ID.

Selecting and Deleting Recipes: Users can select multiple recipes by clicking on them. Selected recipes are stored in the selectedRecipes state in the Zustand store. The user can then delete the selected recipes by clicking the "Delete" button.

Zustand State Management: The application uses the Zustand library for state management. The Zustand store provides functions to fetch recipes, select and delete recipes, and maintains the state of the recipes, selected recipes, and total recipe count.

The project structure follows a component-based architecture, where reusable components like RecipeCard and RecipePage are used to display recipe-related information.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
